# Meteor Santa Design

General design constraints:

1. The time required of everyone to use ```meteor santa``` should be dramatically lower than the in-person version of the game to pass the hat around
1. The digital experience should match the real-life "pass the hat around" in-person experience as much as possible which would make the system intuitive to use
1. Should be easy to understand and use by both organizers and participants, and handle exception cases gracefully or completely avoid or pre-emptively point out inconsistent/impossible matching as early as possible
1. 

Other non-functional requirements:
- Allow for scalability and modularity where possible, no need to think too far ahead
- 


## CLI app UX
Imagine one command line interface on a computer, and the computer is passed around for everyone to type in their names and identify who they don't want to receive a present from (the better half).

## Web/mobile app UX
Same as the CLI, with familiar UI components

## Real-time personalized experience for each user
